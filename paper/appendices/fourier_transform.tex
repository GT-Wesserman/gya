\section{Fourier Transform}
The Fourier Transform (FT) is a method which allows one to decompose a function into a, sometimes infinite, sum[or  should I write Intergral here?] of simple sinisodul functions. Specifically, the FT takes a function as an input and outputs a new function with the independant variable of frequency where puting the frequency into the function gives a value which represents how much of that frequency is present within the original function. This has shown to have many useful application and as such a basic understanding of the FT gives deeper insight into some of these fields.
