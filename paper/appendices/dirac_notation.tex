\section{Dirac Notation}
Within quantum mechanics, vectors and lini transformations play an important role. However, as anyone familiar with liniear algebra can tell you, vectors and matricies, which represent linear transformations, can have differet apperances depending on the basis choosen. This, togheter with other needs for a conviniet way to notate vectors and transformations, can be met by using Dirac notation.
