    \caption{Top images showcase spin direction in real space for ferromagnets, antiferromagnets and altermagnets. The $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes represent real space. The images below show the band splitting, or lack thereof, for each type of magnet in the k-space (also known as momentum space) \cite{song2025altermagnets}. Here, the $x$- and $y$-axes show position in k-space, while the $z$-axes show the energy. The red and blue bands show the difference in energy for spin up and spin down.}
