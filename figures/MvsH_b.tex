    \caption{M vs. H measurements for different temperatures along the b-axis. All R² values for linear fits of the data are 1.000 when using 4 significant figures, meaning the susceptibility is indeed linearly dependent on the applied field. The x-axis shows the magnetic field measured in Oe, while the y-axis shows the magnetic moment measured in emu.}
