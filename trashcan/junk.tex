%\subsection{Bloch's Law}    Bloch's law describes how the magnetization of a ferromagnetic or a ferrimagnetic material decreases with increasing temperature. The law is expressed as    \begin{equation}\label{eq:bloch-law}        M(T)=M(0)(1-(\frac{T}{T_C})^{3/2})    \end{equation}    where $M(T)$ is the magnetization, $M(0)$ is the magnetization at the temperature $T=0$K, $T$ is the temperature and $T_C$ is the so called Curie temperature. The law has been shown to be followed at low temperatures but not at higher ones.
