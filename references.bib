journal = {European Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The reciprocal lattice is derived through the Fourier transform of a generic crystal lattice, as done previously in the literature. A few key derivations are this time handled in detail, and the connection with x-ray diffraction is clearly pointed out. The Ewald sphere is subsequently thoroughly explained and a few comments on its representation in a mixed real–reciprocal space are made. In particular, it appears that the majority of textbooks or papers on the subject are limited in their way of picturing it. This paper will be useful to solid state and/or crystallography teachers. It is also suitable for graduate students researching these subjects and for talented undergraduate students.}
